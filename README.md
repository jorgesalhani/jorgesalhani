### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love sunny days. I love fuits with yoghurt and honey. I love coffe as well, as almost everyone, I guess.

Here I try to keep my beautiful messy soup from my study time. From [Mechanical Statistics](https://github.com/jorgesalhani/MechanicalStatistics) and [Discrete Maths](https://github.com/jorgesalhani/DiscreteMaths1/), going through [Complex Network](https://github.com/jorgesalhani/ComplexNetworkDynamics), [Data Science](https://github.com/jorgesalhani/IntroDataScience) and [Data Structure](https://github.com/jorgesalhani/AlgorithmsDataStructure1), to miscellaneous stuff such as [Web Scrapping](https://github.com/jorgesalhani/ScrapingAndGoogleApi)

They all might be incomplete, but sucking at sumthinâ€™ is the first step towards being sorta good at something, right?

With love!
